# KNN-FOR-IRIS
Algorithm used:KNN ALGORITHM

WHAT IS KNN ALGORITHM?
KNN is also known as K-Nearest Neighbor which is one of the Supervised Machine Learning.stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category
It is also known as non-parametric algorithm which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data.It is also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset.


How does KNN algorithm?
Step-1: Select the number K of the neighbors
Step-2: Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors
Step-3: Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.
Step-4: Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category.
Step-5: Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.
Step-6: Our model is ready.
